Strings are a collection of characters. They are immutable and have indeces. Lists are mutable collections of any object (as long as they have the same type) and also have indeces. Dictionaries are mutable, unordered collections of objects and an associated key. Strings and lists have indeces and are thus directly iterable while dictionaries aren't. Dictionaries can store multiple types of objects while strings just store text and lists store one object type."
